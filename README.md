# Movie API
Simple REST API allowing requesting information about movies (but not necessarily limited to that).


With default configuration the user requests using the API's */* endpoint with query parameter *title=<movie title>*.
Requests is authenticated with *Bearer token* provided by the user in *Authorization* header.
API queries for the title in the OMDB (https://www.omdbapi.com/). Converts the response answer from XML to JSON and 
returns it to the user.  

## Prerequisites
(if you do not wish to install anything use the attached *docker-compose* file.):
* Python 3.9
* Pipenv

optionally: 
* Docker

optionally^2: 
* https://movie-api-infor.herokuapp.com?title=<movie title>
** Remember to use *Authorization* header with token: `Bearer d1b9c69a-ec83-4bf4-9fac-c36ce4af47da`

If you don't know or are unable to process the request in any other way you can use:
`
https://reqbin.com/
`

## Installing Movie API

To install File system API, follow these steps:
* Clone the repository and create a virtual environment with pipenv to install all the needed libraries
```
$ pipenv install
```
Create the following environmental variables:
```
XML_API_URI=https://www.omdbapi.com/?r=xml&apikey=<your api key> - tagert server address with
API_KEY=<applications key>
```
Optionally it is possible override additional settings:
```
XML_ATTRIBUTES=["title", "year", ...] - list of XML resposne attributes to be searched for
XML_QUERY_PARAMETER=t - query parameter for the target server
PORT=5000 - host port
HOST=0.0.0.0 - host address
QUERY_PARAMETER=title - query parameter name 
```

## Using Movie API

To use Movie API simply start it with:
```
python run.py 
```
Or use the provided `docker-compose.yml`. 

The API has only one endpoint `/`.

### Testing Movie API

To test Movie API run:
```
docker-compose run task2-api sh -c "pytest tests"
```
**Remember to update *docker-compose* XML_API_URI with your OMDB api key.

### Additional information
The application uses Flask framework with Flask-RESTful extension. 

The reason to for using a framework it is to facilitate the very creation of the API and later on it's maintenance and
 possible extension.
 
By taking the advantage of working, richly documented, constantly updated solutions which are supported by a huge 
community we can focus on the very core of our tasks - creating the part of the application containing logic for the 
business objectives and delivering reliable solutions faster.

Besides using the aforementioned framework the application uses Python standard libraries: *logging* for logging, 
*urllib.request* for handling requests and responses from target server and optionally *xml.etree*.
The *xml.etree* is not used actively - it's usage has to be enabled in the *config.py* file. 
By default all XML parsing is done "manually".
